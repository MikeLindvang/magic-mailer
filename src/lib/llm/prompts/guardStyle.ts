## STYLE CARD REQUIREMENTS:
**Tone:** ${styleCard.tone}
**Voice:** ${styleCard.voice}
**Style:** ${styleCard.style}
**Target Audience:** ${styleCard.audience}

${styleCard.guidelines && styleCard.guidelines.length > 0 ? `
**Style Guidelines:**
${styleCard.guidelines.map(guideline => `- ${guideline}`).join('\n')}
` : ''}

${styleCard.examples && styleCard.examples.length > 0 ? `
**Style Examples:**
${styleCard.examples.map((example, index) => `${index + 1}. ${example}`).join('\n')}
` : ''}

## DRAFT TO ANALYZE:

**Subject Line:** ${draft.subject}

**Email Content (Markdown):**
${draft.md}

**Email Content (Plain Text):**
${draft.txt}

## ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:

Carefully analyze the draft against the style card requirements. Look for mismatches in:

1. **Tone Alignment**: Does the draft match the required tone (formal, casual, friendly, professional, etc.)?
2. **Voice Consistency**: Does the voice match the brand personality and communication style?
3. **Style Adherence**: Does the writing style match the specified approach (conversational, technical, persuasive, etc.)?
4. **Audience Appropriateness**: Is the language, complexity, and approach suitable for the target audience?
5. **Subject Line**: Does it align with the overall style requirements?
6. **Content Structure**: Does the organization and flow match the style expectations?
7. **Language Choices**: Are word choices, sentence structure, and phrasing consistent with the style card?

## SCORING CRITERIA:
- 90-100: Excellent alignment, minor or no issues
- 80-89: Good alignment, few minor issues
- 70-79: Acceptable alignment, some notable issues
- 60-69: Poor alignment, multiple significant issues
- Below 60: Major misalignment, requires substantial revision

## REQUIRED JSON RESPONSE FORMAT:

You must respond with valid JSON in exactly this structure:

{
  "mismatches": [
    {
      "area": "Specific area of concern (e.g., 'Tone', 'Subject Line', 'Opening Paragraph', 'Call-to-Action')",
      "issue": "Clear description of what doesn't match the style card",
      "fix": "Specific, actionable recommendation to fix the issue"
    }
  ],
  "overall_score": 85,
  "recommendations": [
    "High-level recommendation for overall improvement",
    "Another strategic suggestion for better style alignment"
  ]
}

## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:

1. **Be Specific**: Don't just say "tone is wrong" - explain exactly what about the tone doesn't match and why.

2. **Provide Actionable Fixes**: Each fix should be specific enough that a writer could implement it immediately.

3. **Focus on Style, Not Content**: Analyze how things are said, not what is said (unless content directly conflicts with audience appropriateness).

4. **Consider All Formats**: Analyze both the markdown and plain text versions, noting if formatting affects style perception.

5. **Be Constructive**: Frame issues as opportunities for improvement rather than failures.

6. **Prioritize Impact**: Focus on mismatches that would most significantly affect the reader's perception and engagement.

7. **Score Fairly**: Base the overall score on how well the draft would perform with the target audience given the style requirements.

Analyze the draft thoroughly and provide your response in the exact JSON format specified above.`;
